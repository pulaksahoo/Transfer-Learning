# Transfer-Learning
The project implements a technique called "Transfer Learning" using Imagenet pretrained models VGG19 or ResNet50.
Get the pretrained model and verify the accuracy on the CPUs/GPUs.
Take a new image data set like for example, fish data-set:
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/f4k/GROUNDTRUTH/RECOG/
Use the transfer learning technique to freeze a few layers of the
pretrained models and retrain using the new data set
Show the accuracy on the new data-set should be roughly equal to or
more than original imagenet accuracy.
use TF framework
